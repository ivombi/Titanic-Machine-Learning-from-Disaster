# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This project was aimed at using machine learning techniques to create models to predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. Data exploration and preprocessing was done to get the train dataset ready for training. Three models were used, logistic regression, random forest and support vector classifier.
